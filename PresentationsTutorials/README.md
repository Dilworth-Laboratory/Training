Computing 1 - Intro (command-line usage, Linux, Python, R, bash/shell, managing environments)  
Computing 2 - Reads Processing Pipeline (HPC usage, file downloads + setup, run options, batch submissions, outputs)  
Computing 3 - Differential Analysis (bulk RNA-Seq differential expression and peaks analysis for differential binding in ChIP-Seq/CUT&Tag)
